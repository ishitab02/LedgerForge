# LedgerForge — Demo Video Script (Option B: three-act demo)

**Target length:** 4:20 — 4:40. Hard cap 4:45.
**One-take, screen-recorded.** No talking head, no music, no slide deck. The product carries the demo.
**Recording setup:**
- Terminal in iTerm at 18pt font, ~120×30, in `~/Developer/ledgerforge/agents/`
- Browser tabs preloaded in this order: `https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ledgerforge/x402-mantle`, `https://mantlescan.xyz/address/0x1d550b555B3a2e124ef611b55965848d6be233a2`, `https://mantlescan.xyz/address/0x8004BAa17C55a88189AE136b182e5fdA19dE9b63`
- Editor (VS Code) with Markdown preview, ready to open the latest digests from `agents/scout-runs/`, `agents/perps-coach-runs/`, and `agents/spawn-auditor-runs/`
- A snippet ready to paste/show: a short SDK code sample (see Shot 6)

The narration is written to be read straight from this page. Pauses are marked `[…]`. Total narration ≈ 580 words ≈ 3:50 at conversational pace; the remaining ~30-40s is action/scrolling/clicks.

## Shot 1 — The vision hook (0:00 — 0:30)

**On screen:** terminal, clear, prompt visible. Or a blank-ish editor view of `agents/src/autonomous-scout.ts` zoomed out so the structure reads as "this is a real codebase." Don't show your face.

**Say:**

> "Autonomous agents can write code, run analysis, and call APIs. But they can't pay for things autonomously. Every existing payment rail — Stripe, ACH, even most crypto wallets — was built for humans with accounts, KYC, and monthly invoices."

> "Agents need something different: per-call payments, signed authorization with no stored credentials, on-chain proof of every transaction, and reputation that follows the agent across platforms. That's x402 — the emerging standard for HTTP-native payments."

> "LedgerForge is the production rail for x402 on Mantle. To prove it works, I'm not going to run one agent — I'm going to run three, in three different domains, all on the same SDK."

---

## Shot 2 — The setup (0:30 — 0:45)

**On screen:** terminal. Type `npm run scout` but don't press enter yet.

**Say:**

> "Three agents. Same SDK, same wallet, same payment rail. First — an autonomous DeFi scout that pays for live market data and recommends a rotation. One command."

[Hit enter.]

---

## Shot 3 — Act 1: Scout (0:45 — 2:00)

**On screen:** Scout output streaming. Don't skip ahead — let the latency feel real. Narrate tighter than the lean version; this is Act 1 of three.

> ⚠ **Read live numbers off screen.** Job IDs and APRs change every run. Safe-to-quote constants: **85% confidence**, **20bps fee**, **0.0499/0.0001 USDC payout split**.

**Say (across the run):**

> "Pre-flight passes. Five paid skills in sequence: Byreal top pools, Aave V3 rates, token prices, gas oracle, and — if it decides to rotate — a swap preview."

[As each `✓` lands, brief tag-line:]

> "Byreal top pools. Job ID — [read off screen]. Aave V3 USDC supply. Token prices. Gas oracle."

[Decision line — speak slowly:]

> "Top Byreal pool at — [read percent]. Aave USDC at — [read percent]. Huge delta. The agent recommends ENTER_POOL — eighty-five percent confidence. So it pays for one more skill: Byreal swap preview — to model the trade."

[Fifth `✓` lands:]

> "Five settlements, twenty-five Mantle transactions, two minutes, twenty-five cents. That's Act One."

---

## Shot 4 — Act 2: Perps Coach (2:00 — 2:30)

**On screen:** clear the terminal (or split-pane). Type `npm run perps-coach` and run it.

**Say (across the run):**

> "Second agent — different domain entirely. The Perps Coach scans three open Byreal perps positions — BTC long, ETH long, SOL long — and issues a coaching recommendation for each: hold, reduce, take profit, or avoid."

[As paid signals settle:]

> "Three perps-signals skills, one token-price feed, one gas oracle. All paid through the same SDK, all settled on-chain."

[Decision table prints:]

> "Per-position decisions. Different verdicts per coin based on real Byreal signals. Same payment rail, completely different use case."

---

## Shot 5 — Act 3: Spawn Auditor (2:30 — 3:00)

**On screen:** terminal. Run `npm run spawn-auditor`.

**Say (across the run):**

> "Third agent — zero finance. The Spawn Auditor verifies an AI deployment before it goes live. It pays for three independent analyzers: failure history, lineage context, and on-chain decision-hash verification. Then it issues an APPROVE or BLOCK verdict with remediations."

[Verdict prints:]

> "That's the demo. Three agents. DeFi research, perps coaching, AI deploy auditing. Same SDK, same wallet, same x402 rail. The platform isn't just one demo — it's a marketplace."

---

## Shot 6 — Digest deep-dive + on-chain proof (3:00 — 3:40)

**On screen:** open the freshly written Scout digest in VS Code's Markdown preview (Cmd+Shift+V). Scroll to the **Settlements** table, then the **Reputation writes** table immediately below it.

**Say:**

> "Every run writes a markdown digest. TL;DR at top. Decision. Reasoning. Then the proof — every settlement with paste-able mantlescan links."

[Click the first `completeJob` link.]

> "Verify on-chain. Escrow contract paying the provider 0.0499 USDC, twenty-basis-point fee, skill ID in the event log. Real x402 settlement."

[Back to digest, click any ERC-8004 feedback link.]

> "And the reputation writes — every paid call updates the provider's portable reputation on the canonical ERC-8004 registry."

---

## Shot 7 — The SDK as a product (3:40 — 4:10)

**On screen:** the **npm package page**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ledgerforge/x402-mantle

**Say:**

> "All three agents are built on this SDK — live on npm. One install."

[Switch to editor showing this snippet:]

```ts
import { LedgerForgeClient } from "@ledgerforge/x402-mantle";

const client = new LedgerForgeClient({ privateKey });
const skills = await client.listSkills({ minScore: 80 });
const { output, receipt } = await client.invoke(skills[0].skillId, {
  amount: "50000",                  // 0.05 USDC
  query: { asset: "USDC" },
});
console.log(receipt.escrowJobId, receipt.completeJobTxHash);
```

> "`listSkills` returns reputation-ranked services. `invoke` does the EIP-712 signing, the escrow custody, the settlement, and the reputation write in a single async call. Anyone with a Mantle wallet can build an autonomous agent that pays — or earns — through this rail."

---

## Shot 8 — ERC-8004 + close (4:10 — 4:30)

**On screen:** mantlescan tab on the ERC-8004 Reputation Registry contract page (`0x8004BAa1…`). Let the address sit on screen.

**Say:**

> "Every settlement writes to ERC-8004 — the canonical reputation standard. A skill's track record isn't locked to LedgerForge. Any other ERC-8004 marketplace can read the same reputation. We're not building a silo. We're building rails."

> "When a thousand agents pay a thousand skills every day across this rail, that's an economy. We're shipping it. LedgerForge."

[Stop recording.]

## Things to do BEFORE recording

1. **Top up the consumer wallet.** Three agents in one take ≈ ~0.75 USDC + ~0.15 MNT. Have ≥2 USDC and ≥0.3 MNT or you'll abort mid-recording.
2. **Verify all three live URLs.** Run `npm run demos:dry-run` once an hour before recording — confirms wiring + warms the Fly cold-start on each skill server.
3. **Pre-fetch every browser tab.** Cold-starts during the recording look unprofessional.
4. **Pre-pick a Scout digest as a "safe" digest.** If perps-coach or spawn-auditor produces a weird-looking output (e.g. all HOLD), Shot 6 should open the Scout digest — it has the richest narrative.
5. **Make the SDK snippet file ready** at `~/scratch/sdk-snippet.ts` so Shot 7 is a single Cmd+Tab away.
6. **Clear scroll history**, terminal at 18pt, ~120×30, short prompt.

## Things to do AFTER recording

1. Trim aggressively between settlements in Shots 3-5 — keep enough latency visible to feel real, compress the rest.
2. End-card at 4:30: project name, GitHub URL, DoraHacks URL, your handle. 3-5 seconds, then black.
3. Total upload under 4:45.
4. Sound-off sanity check — story should land even if narration is gone.

## Fallback: 3:30 lean cut

If editing pushes past 4:45:

1. Drop **Shot 5 (Spawn Auditor)** entirely — keep Scout + Perps Coach for the multi-agent story. Mention spawn-auditor in one sentence at Shot 8.
2. Or drop **Shot 4 (Perps Coach)** if Spawn fits the AI DevTools angle better for your panel.
3. Compress Shot 3's narration further — let visuals carry it.

The vision hook (Shot 1), the SDK shot (Shot 7), and the ERC-8004 close (Shot 8) are non-negotiable. Everything else can flex.

## Backup: pre-recorded runs

If you don't want to spend USDC on the take:

- Run all three agents ahead of time, capture the terminal output for Shots 3-5.
- Shot 6 reads a real digest file live.
- Shots 7-8 are unchanged.
- Judges still see real mainnet txs via mantlescan; only the terminal animation is pre-rendered.
