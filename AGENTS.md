## 1. Project Description

LedgerForge is three-layer reputation-native agent service marketplace infrastructure for Mantle Network: an HTTP-native x402 stablecoin payment rail (first on Mantle), an on-chain `SkillRegistry` that gives every agent service provider a permanent ERC-8004 identity, and a discovery Bazaar that ranks services by provable on-chain execution history.

## 2. Hackathon Context

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Hackathon | Mantle Turing Test Hackathon 2026 — AI Awakening, Phase 2 |
| Deadline | **June 15, 2026** |
| Primary track | Agentic Wallets & Economy (Byreal-sponsored) |
| Secondary track | AI DevTools |
| Chain | Mantle Mainnet — chainId `5000` |
| Prize pool | TBD — check hackathon portal |
| Judge panel | TBD — check hackathon portal |

**Why this project fits the tracks:**
- *Agentic Wallets & Economy*: x402 is payment infrastructure specifically for autonomous agents — the escrow, stablecoin settlement, and per-execution economics are the core product.
- *AI DevTools*: `@ledgerforge/x402-mantle` SDK and the Bazaar discovery API let any developer register an agent skill and monetize it in minutes.

## 3. Architecture Overview

Three layers, each with a distinct trust model and deployment footprint.

### Layer 1 — x402 Facilitator (off-chain HTTP server)

The facilitator implements the x402 "HTTP payment channel" spec. Flow:

1. Consumer agent sends a standard HTTP request to a provider endpoint.
2. Provider (or facilitator proxy) responds `402 Payment Required` with a signed payment challenge.
3. Consumer signs an EIP-3009 `transferWithAuthorization` for USDe or USDC and POSTs it to the facilitator.
4. Facilitator validates the signature, locks funds in `x402Escrow` on-chain, and forwards the job to the provider.
5. Provider executes the job and returns a result + proof to the facilitator.
6. Facilitator calls `x402Escrow.release()` (net of fee) and writes `recordExecution()` to the ERC-8004 Reputation Registry.
7. Facilitator returns the settlement receipt to the consumer.

**Key invariant:** The facilitator is the only party that needs to be on the ERC-8004 reputation operator allowlist. Neither the consumer nor the SkillRegistry contract need allowlist access.

### Layer 2 — Smart Contracts (Mantle Mainnet)

| Contract | Role |
|---|---|
| `SkillRegistry` | Registers agent skills as ERC-8004 identities; stores endpoint URL, accepted tokens, price-per-call |
| `x402Escrow` | Holds payment during job execution via EIP-3009; released by the trusted facilitator operator |
| `BazaarListings` | Stores display metadata (name, description, tags, logoURI) linked to SkillRegistry by skillId |

`BazaarListings` never writes reputation — that is the facilitator's job via the external ERC-8004 registry.

### Layer 3 — Bazaar (read-only discovery)

The Bazaar frontend and API read skill listings from `BazaarListings` (or the indexer's local SQLite DB for speed) and sort them by ERC-8004 reputation score. Ranking is purely read-only — no contract writes needed to compute or display rankings. The sort formula can be updated without redeploying contracts.

## 9. Critical Technical Decisions

### 1. Facilitator is a standalone HTTP server, not a smart contract

The x402 spec treats payment coordination as an HTTP-layer concern (RFC-style 402 response codes). A contract-based facilitator would require every job request to touch the chain twice (lock + release) with no ability to validate off-chain job results. The HTTP server approach: lower gas costs, richer error handling, and direct compatibility with the x402 reference implementation from Coinbase.

### 2. Facilitator owns ERC-8004 reputation writes (not SkillRegistry)

The ERC-8004 Reputation Registry requires callers to be on an operator allowlist. Having `SkillRegistry` call `recordExecution` would require putting the registry contract address on the allowlist — which depends on the ERC-8004 deployer granting it. Instead, the facilitator operator wallet writes reputation after each settlement. Only one address needs allowlist access, and it's controlled by us.

### 3. EIP-3009 `transferWithAuthorization` for gasless consumer payments

Standard ERC-20 requires an `approve` transaction before the escrow can pull tokens — two on-chain txs for the consumer. EIP-3009 lets the consumer sign an off-chain message; the facilitator submits the lock transaction. Consumer's on-chain footprint for payment initiation: zero. Only the facilitator pays gas for the lock.

### 4. Bazaar ranking is read-only (no on-chain writes)

`BazaarListings.sol` stores display metadata only. The Bazaar sort algorithm lives in the API/frontend and reads ERC-8004 reputation via `getReputation()`. This means ranking logic can be iterated (new weights, decay functions, stake-boost) without redeploying any contract.

### 5. x402 V1 (per-request), not V2 (session)

The x402 V2 spec adds session tokens for amortizing payment overhead across multiple requests. V2 implementation adds complexity (session management, token expiry, revocation). For hackathon scope, we implement V1: one payment challenge per request. V2 is a post-hackathon extension.

### 6. USDe as primary token, USDC as fallback

USDe (Ethena) is the first-class payment token — it aligns with the Mantle/Ethena ecosystem partnership and is the stablecoin most relevant to the Byreal track judges. USDC is a fallback for providers or consumers who prefer it. Both must be verified to implement EIP-3009 on Mantle before `verifier.ts` is written.

### 7. Facilitator uses EIP-712 + standard transferFrom, not EIP-3009 (implementation decision)

During facilitator implementation, EIP-3009 `transferWithAuthorization` was replaced with EIP-712 typed-data signing + standard ERC-20 `approve`/`transferFrom`. Reason: EIP-3009 support on Mantle-deployed USDe/USDC was not confirmed at implementation time (see §10 gotcha), and the EIP-712 path is unambiguously supported by all ERC-20 tokens. Trade-off: consumers must submit one `approve` tx before the first payment, adding an on-chain step. This is acceptable for hackathon scope. EIP-3009 path can be added to `verifier.ts` once token support is confirmed via `cast call`.

### 8. Indexer doubles as the Bazaar HTTP API server

The indexer (`@ledgerforge/indexer`) serves both the chain event listener role and the Bazaar API (`GET /skills`, `GET /stats`, `GET /jobs`) on `BAZAAR_API_PORT`. This avoids running a separate API server process. The SQLite DB is the single source of truth for all dashboard data. If the indexer is down, the dashboard falls back to hardcoded demo data automatically.

### 9. BazaarListings tier enum drives Bazaar sort order

The indexer's `fetchSkillTier()` reads `BazaarListings.listings(skillId)` to get the uint8 tier enum and maps it to `FREE | BASIC | PRO`. The `getSkillsSortedByReputation()` DB query sorts PRO → BASIC → FREE first, then by average ERC-8004 reputation score within each tier. Tier data is cached in SQLite and kept in sync via `Listed`, `TierUpgraded`, and `Renewed` contract events.

---

## 10. Known Limitations and Gotchas

### CRITICAL: ERC-8004 Identity Registry may have no bytecode

`0x8004A818BFB912233c491871b3d84c89A494BD9e` on Mantle mainnet may still be undeployed or have no code at that address. **Before any call**, check:

```typescript
const code = await publicClient.getBytecode({ address: ERC8004_IDENTITY });
if (!code || code === '0x') {
  // registry not deployed — skip identity registration, continue with local tracking
}
```

Wrap all identity registry calls in try/catch. See Spawn Protocol's reference implementation for a working fallback pattern. The Reputation Registry at `0x8004B663...` may have the same issue — verify both before building.

### EIP-3009 support: verify before building verifier.ts

`transferWithAuthorization(from, to, value, validAfter, validBefore, nonce, v, r, s)` is NOT part of the ERC-20 standard. To verify:

```bash
# Check selector 0xe3ee160e is present on USDe
cast code 0x5d3a1Ff2b6BAb83b63cd9AD0787074081a52ef34 --rpc-url https://rpc.mantle.xyz | grep -c e3ee160e
```

If either token doesn't support EIP-3009, fall back to the standard `approve` + `transferFrom` flow.

### x402 V2 session support not implemented

Consumers or tooling expecting x402 V2 session tokens will not be compatible with this facilitator. Document this clearly in the SDK README.

### Mantle gas token is MNT, not ETH

All `estimateGas` calls and gas cost displays must treat the native token as MNT. MNT price differs from ETH — never assume 1:1. Use `publicClient.estimateGas()` and display in MNT with the MNT/USD price feed.

### Facilitator fee is deducted before provider settlement

`FACILITATOR_FEE_BPS` basis points are taken from the locked amount before releasing the remainder to the provider. Example: 100 USDC job at 20 bps → provider receives 99.80 USDC, facilitator keeps 0.20 USDC. Providers must price their services accounting for this.

### Operator allowlist for ERC-8004 reputation writes

The facilitator's `OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY` wallet must be added to the ERC-8004 Reputation Registry's allowlist before any `recordExecution` call will succeed. Contact the ERC-8004 registry operator (Mantle team / ERC-8004 deployer) with the operator wallet address to request allowlist addition. **Do this early** — it is a dependency blocker for the full payment flow.

### Single operator trust model (hackathon scope)

There is currently one trusted facilitator operator. The operator can theoretically refuse to settle, write incorrect reputation, or front-run payments. A decentralized operator set (e.g., multiple keyholders or a threshold signature scheme) is out of scope for the hackathon.

---

## 11. Security Considerations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Private key exposure | `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` and `OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY` must never be committed. Rotate immediately if exposed. |
| EIP-3009 replay attack | `x402Escrow` must track used nonces per-user. Reuse of a nonce must revert. |
| Reentrancy in escrow | Use checks-effects-interactions pattern or OpenZeppelin `ReentrancyGuard` on `release()` and `cancel()`. |
| Signature malleability | Use OpenZeppelin `ECDSA.recover()` (rejects high-s sigs) in contracts and `viem`'s `recoverAddress` in the facilitator. |
| EIP-3009 front-running | Set `validBefore` to ≤ 5 minutes from signing time. Tight validity windows prevent mempool front-running. |
| Amount overflow/underflow | Use Solidity 0.8.x built-in checked arithmetic. Validate `amount > FACILITATOR_MIN_AMOUNT` in the facilitator before submitting the lock tx. |
| Operator key compromise | The operator wallet can write arbitrary reputation. For production: use a hardware wallet or HSM. For hackathon: use a dedicated throwaway key, not the deployer key. |
| Dust attacks | `FACILITATOR_MIN_AMOUNT` enforces a minimum payment to prevent griefing via high-frequency micro-payments. |
