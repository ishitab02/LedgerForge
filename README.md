# LedgerForge

**The reputation-native agent service marketplace for Mantle Network.**

---

## What It Does

The agent economy has a trust problem. When an autonomous agent wants to hire another agent — for code generation, data analysis, API access, or any on-demand compute — there is no reliable way to know which providers are trustworthy, what they charge, or whether they will deliver. Existing service marketplaces use off-chain ratings that can be gamed, are siloed per platform, and carry no cryptographic weight. Agents have no persistent economic identity and no track record that follows them across deployments.

LedgerForge solves this with three parts: an HTTP-native x402 payment rail that makes AI agents first-class economic participants on Mantle, an on-chain `SkillRegistry` that gives every service provider a permanent ERC-8004 identity, and automatic reputation updates written to the blockchain after every successful job execution. Every payment is escrowed, every settlement is on-chain, and every reputation score is derived directly from provable execution history — not self-reported ratings.

Mantle is the right chain for this. MNT gas costs are low enough to make per-execution reputation writes economically viable (not just per-listing). The Mantle ecosystem natively includes Ethena USDe as a stablecoin — the primary payment token for LedgerForge. And Mantle's ERC-8004 standard provides exactly the agent identity and reputation primitives the system requires. No other L2 has this combination ready today.

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts (Mantle Mainnet)

| Contract | Address | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `SkillRegistry` | [`0x37041F257Bf8f1E201497Dc0BCDa1ae0d8317992`](https://mantlescan.xyz/address/0x37041F257Bf8f1E201497Dc0BCDa1ae0d8317992) | Registers skills as ERC-8004 identities; stores endpoint URL, accepted tokens, price-per-call |
| `x402Escrow` | [`0x1d550b555B3a2e124ef611b55965848d6be233a2`](https://mantlescan.xyz/address/0x1d550b555B3a2e124ef611b55965848d6be233a2) | Holds payment in escrow via EIP-3009; released by facilitator after job completion |
| `BazaarListings` | [`0xaB5a52C30D769A7Eae1474857A6180E71765CBAF`](https://mantlescan.xyz/address/0xaB5a52C30D769A7Eae1474857A6180E71765CBAF) | Stores listing display metadata (name, description, tags, logoURI) |
| ERC-8004 Identity Registry | [`0x8004A169FB4a3325136EB29fA0ceB6D2e539a432`](https://mantlescan.xyz/address/0x8004A169FB4a3325136EB29fA0ceB6D2e539a432) | Canonical ERC-8004 identity registry on Mantle (v2, verified) |
| ERC-8004 Reputation Registry | [`0x8004BAa17C55a88189AE136b182e5fdA19dE9b63`](https://mantlescan.xyz/address/0x8004BAa17C55a88189AE136b182e5fdA19dE9b63) | Canonical ERC-8004 reputation registry on Mantle (v2.0.0 ERC-1967 proxy) |

### Facilitator Server

The facilitator is a TypeScript/Express HTTP server that coordinates x402 payments. It validates the signed payment, moves funds through `x402Escrow`, forwards the job to the provider, and releases payment after completion. After settlement, it writes the result to the ERC-8004 Reputation Registry so the provider's on-chain score moves with real usage. The facilitator fee defaults to 20 bps / 0.2%.

The facilitator is intentionally the only party on the ERC-8004 reputation operator allowlist. This avoids requiring smart contract whitelisting and keeps the trust surface minimal.

### The Bazaar

The Bazaar is discovery. The Next.js frontend and API read listings from `BazaarListings` or the indexer DB, then sort by ERC-8004 reputation data. Ranking is read-only, so the sort formula can change without redeploying contracts. Consumers can filter by token, price, and category.

### Proven on-chain: autonomous agent run

The LedgerForge Scout agent (`npm run scout`) ran live on Mantle Mainnet, paying for 5 skills sequentially and writing an ENTER_POOL decision with 85% confidence. Every settlement is verifiable on Mantlescan:

| # | Skill | escrowJobId | `completeJob` tx |
|---|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | byreal-top-pools | `11` | [0xe7656e52fe…](https://mantlescan.xyz/tx/0xe7656e52fe69718cee61e126efdad3c27f932762ca1b45817dacedb5bf2f0d33) |
| 2 | aave-v3-rates | `12` | [0x257289318a…](https://mantlescan.xyz/tx/0x257289318a8825b9e5325eedd64047254e1c408780ba935d92975d4cd7b15b06) |
| 3 | token-price-feed | `13` | [0x4be1efebab…](https://mantlescan.xyz/tx/0x4be1efebabf15dcb9e9a45684cdae057722e00ef1be3ecdfac9fb9fd5f8d9199) |
| 4 | mantle-gas-oracle | `14` | [0x985dbd374d…](https://mantlescan.xyz/tx/0x985dbd374d1ae880ac2e4005c44984af140a30078aee604c23eb1bfe93c06740) |
| 5 | byreal-swap-preview | `15` | [0xd55feeb0f3…](https://mantlescan.xyz/tx/0xd55feeb0f390d88353a42af480ab0c6e68f5d689501f424b6aba7990f8b5c7d1) |

Each row = 5 Mantle txs (pull -> createJob -> completeJob -> SkillRegistry rep -> ERC-8004 feedback). One agent run = **25 on-chain transactions**.

Current stats: **15 skills registered · 44+ jobs settled · ~2.25 USDC total revenue** _(as of 2026-05-29; live numbers at [`/stats`](https://ledgerforge-indexer.fly.dev/stats))_

---

## Quick Start

### Use the live deployment (no setup)

```bash
# Browse the skill registry
curl https://ledgerforge-indexer.fly.dev/skills | jq '.skills[] | {skillId, name, endpoint}'

# Check live job settlements
curl https://ledgerforge-indexer.fly.dev/jobs | jq '.[0]'

# Get payment details for a skill
curl "https://ledgerforge-facilitator.fly.dev/payment-details?skillId=11&amount=200000"

# Call a skill directly (simulated payment token)
curl "https://ledgerforge-mantle.fly.dev/mantle-tvl-monitor" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer settled:0xyourtxhash:$(date +%s)"
```

### SDK usage

```bash
npm install @ledgerforge/x402-mantle
```

```typescript
import { LedgerForgeClient } from '@ledgerforge/x402-mantle'

const client = new LedgerForgeClient({
  facilitatorUrl: 'https://ledgerforge-facilitator.fly.dev',
  bazaarApiUrl: 'https://ledgerforge-indexer.fly.dev',
  privateKey: process.env.CONSUMER_PRIVATE_KEY,
  rpcUrl: 'https://rpc.mantle.xyz',
})

// Browse and pay for a skill in one call
const result = await client.invokeSkill(11, { query: 'top Mantle protocols by TVL' })
console.log(result.data)           // live TVL from DeFiLlama
console.log(result.settlementTxHash) // on-chain proof
```

### Run the demo agents

LedgerForge ships **three independent autonomous agents** on the same SDK: different domains, different decision shapes, one rail. Each agent pays for multiple skills, leaves on-chain proof for every settlement, and writes a markdown + JSON digest.

| Agent | Domain | Skills called | Decision shape | Live run |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Scout** | DeFi yield rotation | byreal-top-pools, aave-v3-rates, token-price-feed, mantle-gas-oracle, byreal-swap-preview | `ENTER_POOL` / `STAY` (with confidence + reasoning) | `npm run scout` |
| **Perps Coach** | Byreal perps trading | byreal-perps-signals × N, token-price-feed, mantle-gas-oracle | Per-position: `HOLD` / `REDUCE` / `TAKE_PROFIT` / `AVOID` | `npm run perps-coach` |
| **Spawn Auditor** | AI deploy provenance / audit | spawn-failure-analyst, lineage-context-builder, decision-hash-verifier | `APPROVE` / `BLOCK` with rationale + remediations | `npm run spawn-auditor` |

Each has a free dry-run variant (e.g. `npm run scout:dry-run`) that exercises the full pipeline without broadcasting. `npm run demos:dry-run` runs all three in sequence as an end-to-end smoke test.

```bash
cd agents
npm run demos:dry-run          # all three agents, no on-chain settlements
npm run scout                  # live: ~0.25 USDC, 25 Mantle txs, writes a digest
npm run perps-coach            # live: scans 3 positions, recommends actions
npm run spawn-auditor          # live: audits a Spawn deployment, verdicts APPROVE/BLOCK
```

Outputs land in `agents/scout-runs/`, `agents/perps-coach-runs/`, and `agents/spawn-auditor-runs/`. Each run produces a markdown digest for review and a parallel JSON file for parsing. Demo-provider keys are kept in memory and printed to stderr only; they never touch disk.

#### Worked example: Scout

The Scout agent is the most illustrative end-to-end demo of the rail. In ~2 minutes it:

1. Calls `byreal-top-pools` (paid): top Byreal CLMM pools by 24h APR
2. Calls `aave-v3-rates` (paid): Aave V3 USDC supply APY on Mantle
3. Calls `token-price-feed` (paid): live USDC/USDe stablecoin prices
4. Calls `mantle-gas-oracle` (paid): current swap gas cost in USD
5. **Decides**: if (top pool APR - Aave supply APY) > 5pp and gas < $1, ENTER_POOL
6. If ENTER_POOL: calls `byreal-swap-preview` (paid), models the rotation, captures price impact

That's 5 settlements × 5 mainnet txs each = **25 verifiable on-chain transactions** to produce one rebalance recommendation. Every settlement appears in the digest with paste-able mantlescan links for both the escrow `completeJob` payout and the ERC-8004 `giveFeedback` reputation write.

**Configure thresholds** via env vars: `SCOUT_PRICE_PER_CALL`, `SCOUT_MIN_APR_DELTA_PCT`, `SCOUT_MAX_GAS_USD`. Each agent has its own equivalent env block; see `agents/src/<agent>.ts` for the full list.

### Run the multi-agent client simulator

```bash
cd agents
npm run simulate-clients   # five personas, infinite loop, round scorecard
```

### Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PoulavBhowmick03/ledgerforge
cd ledgerforge
cp .env.example .env
# Fill OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY and CONSUMER_PRIVATE_KEY; contracts are already deployed

cd indexer   && npm install && npm run dev &
cd facilitator && npm install && npm run dev &
cd dashboard   && npm install && npm run dev   # -> http://localhost:3000
```

## Tracks

| Track | Justification |
|---|---|
| **Agentic Wallets & Economy** (Byreal) | LedgerForge is payment infrastructure built specifically for autonomous agents: the x402 rail, EIP-3009 escrow, and per-execution stablecoin settlement are the core product — not a wrapper around an existing payment system |
| **AI DevTools** | The `@ledgerforge/x402-mantle` TypeScript SDK and the Bazaar discovery API are developer tools: any developer can register a skill and start monetizing an agent capability in under 10 minutes |

---

## Revenue Model

1. **Facilitator settlement fee** — 0.2% (20 basis points) taken from every settled job. Scales linearly with marketplace payment volume. No fees on failed or cancelled jobs.
2. **Listing fee** — Optional one-time MNT fee to register a skill in `BazaarListings`. Configurable per-deploy; set to zero for hackathon to bootstrap supply.
3. **Priority ranking boost** — Providers can stake MNT to boost their Bazaar ranking above the reputation-derived floor. Staking revenue goes to a DAO treasury (post-hackathon roadmap item).
4. **Hosted facilitator subscription** — Enterprise consumers using the `@ledgerforge/x402-mantle` SDK at high volume can subscribe to a rate-limited managed facilitator endpoint rather than self-hosting, paying a flat monthly fee.
